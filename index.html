                    <p>After working for three years as a field commissioning engineer with TMEIC, I decided to return to school to get my M.S. 
                        As a researcher at the <a href="http://www.rmlab.org/" target="_blank">Robotics and Mechatronics Lab</a> at Virginia Tech, 
                        I  had the opportunity to gain valuable knowledge and experience working with robotics, mechatronics,  controls, and design.</p>
                    <p>
                        My wife and I moved to Southern California, where I have had the opportunity to work on some fascinating technical challenges at 
                        both Adsys Controls and Kulicke & Soffa. At Adsys, I worked as a control engineer on high enery laser systems and designing computer vision
                        algorithms. I am currently working at Kulicke & Soffa in their ultrasonic group, using Python to automate our testing and performing analysis on
                        next-gen ultasonic transducer designs.
                    <p> 
                        I love the challenge of being faced with a difficult problem and coming up with a clever and creative engineering solution,
                        from my field engineering days to my research experience. There is no better feeling than seeing your efforts result in a process line starting up again, 
                        or a robot starting to move or a pattern begin to emerge from your analysis. </p>

                            collected by my software to perofrm  statistical analysis on new designs. I have presented my analyses on transducers to internal upper level management as 
                            well as for critical customers' engineering decision makers. I have also developed algorithms for automatic paramter tuning used in our

                        <p>While at Adsys Controls, I was the lead controls engineer for several interesting projects. I worked to build a state space model of a complex
                            optical system in Simulink, while on the side built a custom ray tracing program in order to design a non-axisymmetric optic. After that,
                            I led the development of an algorithm for detecting and tracking drones from a moving platform, incorporating inertial feedback as well as optical
                            input. That project was the first time I used Python in a professional sense, and was a great crash course in developing reusable, human-readable, efficient
                            code.  </p>

                            successful working in large and small teams, as I enjoy talking through ideas because not only do team members have excellent suggestions and strategies,

                        <p>My role as a field engineer was both to set up, troubleshoot, and perform application-specific tuning for medium-voltage hardware as well as to diagnose 
                            and repair problems in already installed systems. After working for my first 6 months in Level I steel mill automation, I transitioned to working on 
                            variable frequency drives (VFDs). I spent time all over the world commissioning drives for all kinds of motor control applications. While it was a
                            high-pressure job, especially showing up to a site when the manager immediately informing you the plant is losing tens of thousands dollars during the outage,
                            the feeling after fixing the problem was extremely rewarding. </p>

                            During my time in the lab, I investigated the action of water droplets on the wing of the lacewing insect. I discovered a novel phenomenon 
                            in the manner in which droplet coalesced and "jumped" from the hairy fibers covering the wing, and replicated it with synthetic fibers. 
                            The work eventually resulted in a publication in Physical Review Letters. </p>

                            (which I was able to turn into a class project as well!) machine learning techniques were implemented to analyze NBA data.
                             Principle component analysis (PCA) is utilized to reduce dimensionality of player statistics, which are then aggregated
                              by team and utilized to train a support vector machine (SVM) to predict winners and losers of individual games. K-means
                               clustering is used to detect players whose contributions to their team's success are not adequately represented by statistics.  
                               In the first image below, the results of PCA on the statiscal contributions of each player in the league are shown. The clear grouping of 
                               players led to the analysis in the next image. This one shows the groups resulting from k-means clustering, including groups 3 
                               (All-Star do-it-all NBA forwards) and 4 (Sharpshooting All-Star guards). Finally, the last image shows the a cross-section of the decision boundary for
                                utilizing teams combined PCA component vlaues from the previous year to predict winners in the following year.

                         an active stabilization device was designed and built. Utilizing active disturbance rejection control, the system maintains the stability of the patient’s 
                         head with a single actuator through a compliant mechanism. Below is a diagram of the proof-of-concept prototype from my IDETC conference
